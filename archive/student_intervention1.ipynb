In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose **Logistic Regression**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance (important)**: Logistic Regression had the **highest F1 score**. \n",
    "    * F1 score is a combined measure of (the harmonic mean of) precision and recall.\n",
    "        - Precision is X and \n",
    "        - Recall is Y.\n",
    "    * The other comparable model is SVC. Logistic Regression and SVC have maximum F1 scores of **0.7883** and 0.7808 respectively, with both attaining F1 max at 300 training points. They are significantly higher than the third highest F1 score at 0.7591 for GaussianNB.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cost** (measured by training and prediction times):\n",
    "    * Out of the two models with similar F1 score, Logistic Regression has the **shorter training and prediction time** at < 50% that af SVC's time (**0.0026s to train, 0.0001s to predict** vs SVC 0.0053s to train and 0.0013 to predict). \n",
    "    * The training time is not too high and the prediction time is extremely low at 0.0001s.\n",
    "    * Since minimising computational cost is a concern, Logistic Regression seems like a good choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Available data**\n",
    "    * This is taken into account by the F1 scores used to assess the models. Three models - KNeighborsClassifier, SVC and Logistic Regression - have F1 scores that increase as the number of training datapoints increases. These models may perform even better if we had, say, 500 training data points. One of SVC or KNeighborsClassifier might outperform Logistic Regression. But we only have 300 data points, so we need to make choices based on the F1 scores in the tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 1: Backup in case even Logistic Regression is too computationally expensive: GaussianNB**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the computational cost is considered too great, we choose KNeighborsClassifier, which has a training time of 0.0009s, a prediction time of 0.0004s and an F1 score of 0.7591 on 100 training points, the third highest F1 score and the shortest (training time + prediction time).\n",
    "* It is only trained on 100 datapoints which makes it feel a bit dodgy. I considered choosing KNeighborsClassifier which has the fourth highest F1 score (max at 300 training points) and a shorter training time, but its prediction time of 0.0019s is quite high, making computational cost high.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 2: This may not be the optimal model because we did not tune any parameters.**\n",
    "* The default parameters for e.g. Decision Trees may just be really bad for this example.\n",
